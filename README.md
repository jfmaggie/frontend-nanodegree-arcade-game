Game Intro
-----
Use the arrow keys on keyboard to manipulate the player. Try to avoid the bugs who can bite you. Once you reach the river, you will be safe and get one point. And player will be back to the initial position to start another round. If you get caught by any bug, you will lose this player's life. Too bad. But no worries, another player will be assigned to you to start over. Good luck!

Notes
-----
jQuery and Bootstrap are helping make game responsive.

Game objects are implemneted with JS OOP features.

Game introduction is to be continued.
